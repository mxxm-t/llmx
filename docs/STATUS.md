# llmx - Development Status

Current implementation and remaining work. Historical checkpoints, failed
experiments and raw evidence remain in [ASSETS](ASSETS.md) and
`docs/benchmarks/`; their dated next steps are not current blockers.

## Runtime release checkpoint (2026-09-20)

The completed CPU runtime stack is accepted for release under the user's
performance tradeoff policy: large gains may justify smaller costs elsewhere,
with HF correctness and matched mx comparisons retained. This is a scoped
release decision, not a claim of universal per-phase or per-quant superiority.
The optional placement candidate is not part of this runtime.

The tree combines runtime checkpoint `0d41a7b` with public main `9511a4a`.
All `src/` files remain identical to the runtime parent after Git newline
normalization. CI retry/cache handling and plain Windows build-header error
checks are retained. No inference arithmetic changed during reconciliation.
The original Windows working tree, user files and its root executable are not
replaced by this release.

| Final reconciliation check | Windows MSVC | Linux GCC 13.3 / WSL |
|---|---:|---:|
| CMake Release build | Pass | Pass |
| Native CTest | 10/10 | 10/10 |
| Offline downloader cases | 15/15 | 15/15 |
| Python suite with both HF models required | 11/11 | 11/11 |
| Tiny F32 full-logit maximum HF error | 0.00000070 | 0.00000070 |

These are correctness/build checks; simultaneous jobs and diagnostic synthetic
timings do not supply new performance measurements. The rig's HF container
lacked CMake, so the Linux run used the configured WSL toolchain instead.
Independent merge review verifies that native tests, all eleven Python
components, UBSan, required HF fixtures and downloader checks remain wired.
All 25 Markdown files were reviewed for source alignment, ASCII and local links.

## Performance decision

Current-source Q8 evidence is the fixed monitored comparison: six workers,
ubatch 128, F32 KV, eight measured rounds per model/workload, with all samples
retained. The table reports paired combined-work speed changes for production
versus pinned mx `5542318e74`; positive means faster. Follow-up prefix loading
is outside the timer. See the [complete phase tables and monitoring limits](ASSETS.md#monitored-prefill-comparison-2026-09-20).

| Model / workload | Combined speed vs mx | Approximate 95% interval |
|---|---:|---:|
| 0.6B Q8, primary 215+32 | +19.69% | +15.87% to +23.50% |
| 0.6B Q8, follow-up 1+32 | -2.58% | -12.82% to +7.67% |
| 0.6B Q8, follow-up 9+32 | +12.46% | -15.74% to +40.66% |
| 8B Q8, primary 215+32 | +24.41% | +10.65% to +38.17% |
| 8B Q8, follow-up 1+32 | -4.72% | -16.01% to +6.58% |
| 8B Q8, follow-up 9+32 | -2.87% | -7.61% to +1.88% |

The primary gains support release while the smaller follow-up costs remain
explicit. Zero-crossing intervals do not prove parity or make the costs zero.
Background imbalance, competing-agent jobs and coarse telemetry limit causal
attribution. No sample was discarded or corrected. An idle PC is not required;
future timing must keep monitoring and must not overlap competing agent work.

The latest applicable, separate nine-round F32 comparison is the
[ordered-reduction study](ASSETS.md#ordered-prefill-accumulator-reductions-2026-09-20):

| 0.6B F32 phase | llmx tok/s | mx tok/s | Mean-rate difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Primary prefill | 382.921 | 364.721 | +4.99% |
| Decode | 13.735 | 13.524 | +1.56% |

The backend, inference and quantization sources remain identical to that
`bf122fd` study; later model edits validate construction. This is applicable
historical evidence, not a new F32 measurement on the reconciled tree. Older
F32 deficits and the earlier sub-percent Q8 decode veto are superseded as
release blockers by the later evidence and clarified tradeoff policy. Their
original results remain in ASSETS. Other hardware, quants and workloads need
their own measurements; K-quant optimization remains separate work below.

`Done` denotes implemented and validated functionality in this release tree.
The five-check CI workflow runs after publication; prior four-check passes at
`b266650` and `9511a4a` validate those smaller releases, not this whole stack.
See [CI](CI.md) for the precise workflow scope and local reproduction commands.

## Active feature blocks

### Scoped correctness coverage and remaining HF work

- **Goal:** keep independent HF ground truth and extend coverage where the roadmap requires it.
- **Done:** exact tokenizer fixtures; tiny tied/untied F32 full logits and NLL; real Q8/Q4 ranking and excerpt PPL; HF/Jinja2 follow-up chat fixtures; pinned reference generation and strict consumers. The unchanged real 8B consumer previously passed 37/37 on Windows and Linux with frozen bounds. Real 0.6B F32/Q8 1,943-token plus 32-step continuation checks are archived in ASSETS.
- **Left:** broader full-corpus, maximum-context and per-layer references, plus prospective numerical bounds for any new lossy kernels. Short 8B rankings/excerpts are not deep-context validation.
- **Gotchas:** self-consistency is supplementary. Exact comparison against another llmx path cannot replace HF. Model construction validation does not establish finite weights, arbitrary token-ID safety, request budgets or failed-session recovery.

### Optional prefill placement integration

- **Goal:** carry the measured prefill gain into a lean backend-owned scope without changing decode placement or model math.
- **Done:** scratch integration on `291ce2c` passes Windows/Linux native and HF checks, active-path logits, 0.6B long continuation and Q8 follow-up witnesses. All 54 monitored blocks/162 processes and 66 frozen identities pass independent audit. The complete archive has 580 raw records and 162 local vector identities.
- **Done:** paired primary-prefill gains versus production are +12.378% on 0.6B and +25.216% on 8B. The candidate's 8B one-token follow-up combined speed is -2.893% versus mx. Tradeoffs and workload deviations remain in the complete ASSETS table.
- **Left:** remove temporary A/B controls, integrate the four-file delta, promote lifecycle tests and validate final sources before adopting it. This optional change is not a prerequisite for the completed runtime release.
- **Gotchas:** Windows six-worker, single-group homogeneous topology only; unsupported cases pass through. Restore original masks before return or error. No NUMA memory binding, generic affinity knob, concurrent model submissions or universal speedup is claimed.

### K-quant and device execution work (separate developer branch)

- **Goal:** improve the remaining K-quant decode path and continue ROADMAP #4a without overlapping this release/placement work.
- **Done:** LDEV owns the separate `design/device-execution-model` branch and K-quant experiments. Its changes are not incorporated by this release. TUI measurements and source identities must be reviewed before adoption.
- **Left:** prospective correctness/performance validation for any new quantized-activation path; backend-owned weights/activations and execution lifetime before vendor GPU kernels. Coordinate rebases after release and announce timing reservations.
- **Gotchas:** earlier grouped Q16 failed the unchanged native double-dot accuracy contract. Do not reuse it as a lossless baseline or weaken bounds after observing results. CPU Q8 results do not establish K-quant parity.

## Working rules and ownership

XDEV owns runtime release, validation and optional placement. LDEV owns its
separate K-quant/device work. Coordination uses the TUI on port 8181 and the
shared devlog; the notification watcher is polled explicitly. Builds and tests
may run in parallel when no timing reservation is active. Keep every planned
performance sample, record ordinary machine activity, and report missing
telemetry honestly. GitHub receives main only; feature checkpoints stay on Gitea.
